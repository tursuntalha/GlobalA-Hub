# Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Project

This project contains two distinct sections focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The code for each section is provided separately, and both can be run on Kaggle and Google Colab platforms.


## Setup and Running

### 1. Running on Kaggle

1. Log in to your Kaggle account.
2. Create a new notebook or open an existing one.
3. Upload the downloaded dataset to Kaggle.
4. Run the respective code for supervised or unsupervised learning to analyze the project.

### 2. Running on Google Colab

1. Log in to your Google account and navigate to Google Colab.
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Upload the downloaded dataset to Colab.
4. Run the respective code for supervised or unsupervised learning to analyze the project.

## Project Description

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. In this section, you will find code that demonstrates how to build and evaluate supervised learning models using the provided dataset. Typical techniques include regression and classification.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves analyzing data without pre-labeled responses. This section contains code for performing unsupervised learning tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction on the dataset.

## Requirements

- Kaggle or Google Colab account
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.)
